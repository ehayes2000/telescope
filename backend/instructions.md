I'm creating a tool to search academic papers. I need your help. I've extracted my source data
into the search_index directory. The raw subdirectory has files for each source, with the primary file
being the \*.nxml file..

I'd like to add a `metadata.json` file to each of these subdirectories that has

- title
- authors
- published date

To start use HEAD to read the first 50 lines of 10 of these files. Tell me if the metadata I want is in these files
